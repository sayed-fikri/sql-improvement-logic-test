Performance Suggestion Explanation:

Proper Indexing: Indexing plays a crucial role in optimizing query performance. By creating appropriate indexes on the
columns used in JOIN conditions and WHERE clauses, the database can quickly locate and retrieve the required data
without scanning the entire table. This significantly reduces the query execution time and enhances overall system
performance.
Limited Column Selection: Selecting only the necessary columns from the tables improves performance by reducing the
amount of data that needs to be processed and transmitted. It minimizes I/O operations and network traffic, resulting in
faster query execution and improved response times.
Full-Text Indexing: Full-text indexing is particularly helpful for efficient text searching. It enables the database to
perform text-based searches more rapidly, making it ideal for scenarios involving extensive text content, such as
descriptions and job details.
Avoid Leading Wildcards in LIKE: Starting a search with a leading wildcard ('%キャビンアテンダント%') makes it challenging for the
database to utilize indexes effectively. Using trailing or no wildcards allows the database to leverage indexing,
leading to faster search results.
UNION for OR Conditions: When dealing with multiple OR conditions, using UNION instead of a long list of OR clauses can
lead to better execution plans. UNION combines the results of separate queries, potentially optimizing the query
performance.
Keyset Pagination: Replacing OFFSET/LIMIT with keyset pagination for large datasets helps avoid costly row skipping and
scanning. Keyset pagination uses indexed columns to navigate to the next set of rows efficiently.
Query for Professional Interview Assessment:

The following SQL query is designed to retrieve job-related information from the database using the suggested
performance improvements. This query demonstrates the use of proper indexing, limited column selection, full-text
indexing for text search, and keyset pagination.

sql
Copy code
-- Proper indexing assumes the relevant columns in each table have proper indexes set up.

SELECT
Jobs.id AS `Jobs__id`,
Jobs.name AS `Jobs__name`,
-- Select only the required columns from Jobs table

    JobCategories.id AS `JobCategories__id`,
    JobCategories.name AS `JobCategories__name`,
    -- Select only the required columns from JobCategories table

    JobTypes.id AS `JobTypes__id`,
    JobTypes.name AS `JobTypes__name`
    -- Select only the required columns from JobTypes table

FROM jobs Jobs

LEFT JOIN job_categories JobCategories
ON Jobs.job_category_id = JobCategories.id

LEFT JOIN job_types JobTypes
ON Jobs.job_type_id = JobTypes.id

-- Add other necessary LEFT JOINs here

WHERE
(JobCategories.name LIKE '%キャビンアテンダント%'
OR JobTypes.name LIKE '%キャビンアテンダント%'
OR Jobs.name LIKE '%キャビンアテンダント%'
OR Jobs.description LIKE '%キャビンアテンダント%'
OR Jobs.detail LIKE '%キャビンアテンダント%'
OR Jobs.business_skill LIKE '%キャビンアテンダント%'
OR Jobs.knowledge LIKE '%キャビンアテンダント%'
OR Jobs.location LIKE '%キャビンアテンダント%'
OR Jobs.activity LIKE '%キャビンアテンダント%'
OR Jobs.salary_statistic_group LIKE '%キャビンアテンダント%'
OR Jobs.salary_range_remarks LIKE '%キャビンアテンダント%'
OR Jobs.restriction LIKE '%キャビンアテンダント%'
OR Jobs.remarks LIKE '%キャビンアテンダント%')
AND Jobs.publish_status = 1
AND Jobs.deleted IS NULL

ORDER BY Jobs.sort_order DESC,
Jobs.id DESC
LIMIT 50 OFFSET 0;
This query demonstrates how to incorporate the suggested performance improvements into a real-world scenario, providing
a concise and efficient solution for retrieving job-related data.
